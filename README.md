## TODO

Menu currently handles inputting an int that does not represent a menu option.
However, it doesn't handle the user entering something other than a number, so we should handle this.
Also, test various amounts of input to ensure that the program handles input correctly and doesn't crash.

Various error handling needs to be implemented as outlined in the instructors specifications for the project.

Adding a new movie(to the coming list):
Movie already in list.

Start showing movies with given release date:
The movie doesn't exist. (This should be handled already, I believe.)
Movie already exists in showing list.

Edit a movie:
Movie does not exists(I believe this should be handled already)

Nicer output for displayMovies()

testing merges via eclipse git
